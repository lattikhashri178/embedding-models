## Sentence Embedding & Semantic Similarity 

A Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that converts sentences into high-dimensional numerical embeddings and measures their semantic similarity using cosine similarity.

## Overview

This project uses the pre-trained Sentence Transformer all-mpnet-base-v2 model to transform sentences into 768-dimensional vector representations.

Cosine similarity is then applied to compare these vectors and identify sentences with similar meanings.

## Features

Generate sentence embeddings
Create 768-dimensional vector representations
Calculate cosine similarity
Identify semantically similar sentences
Display complete embedding vectors
Use a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model

 Model
Model: all-mpnet-base-v2
The model converts each sentence into a 768-dimensional embedding vector.
Example:
Sentence: I enjoy coding in Python.

Embedding:
[ 1.70083828e-02  5.86691052e-02 -7.10436329e-02 ... ]````
